## Description

Do there ever exist moments for you when you suddenly find yourself desperately in need of a material good, but the commitment of purchasing it for the long haul is just too much? WELL BOY do we have the solution for YOU! With our web-based app, we provide a method of engaging with your community over the shared interest in temporary goods. Members who have been verified to live in your area can upload items they don't need for a short-term loan, almost like a library. We provide a method of searching for these objects based on a variety of parameters. Our web allows prospective methods to create an account on our website, and their information is encrypted via bCrypt. Furthermore, we have included a message board where you can discuss all the hot happenings going on around town. I don't know how you couldn't use it right now.
